        <p>I am a UK based filmmaker who has worked in the wedding and commercial/advertorial industries for the last 10 years. I am also currently working part time for a video production company – Bullet Media, based in Southampton.</p>
        <p>I have directed music videos for multiple artists and commissioned for corporate & testimonial films for companies like The Scottish Government, Inspiring Scotland, Calmac, Argyll Holidays, Stramash, Oban Times, Oban Live and Vertical Descents. My film “<a href="/work/year-in-the-life-stramash/">A year in the life of Stramash</a>” won the best film judges award at Peebles Outdoor Film Festival. I’d like to think that the variety gives me a unique style and approach to each project. I aim to create films with feeling.</p>
        <p>Alongside my video work, I also film & photograph wildlife in their natural habitat. I really enjoy being out and
        connecting with nature. A few exotic places I have explored searching for wildlife are Portugal, The Amazon Jungle and
        Australia. Some of my work can be found on my wildlife Instagram page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wildlifewestphotography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@wildlifewestphotography</a>.</p>
        <p>I also have keen interests in playing badminton and guitar. Listening to country music is what makes me tick but, I am often listening to Radio one in between to balance out my music tastes.</p>
