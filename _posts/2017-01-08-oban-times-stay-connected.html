          <p>The aim of the film was to advertise the launch of the digitalisation of the local Oban newspaper. It highlights how easy it is to access news from Argyll and the West Highlands using the new digital edition. The film features Argyll people in local locations including the stunning Isle of Kerrera, in and around beautiful Oban and sunny North Connel.</p>
