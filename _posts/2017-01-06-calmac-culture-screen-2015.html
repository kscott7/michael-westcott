          <p>I was lucky enough to win a film competition that allowed me to work alongside digital media agency 29Studios to create a short film that encapsulated my passion for film making and the Scottish islands.Â The film features the beautiful coastal town of Largs, the Isle of Cumbrae and a young lady, named Clare McGonigle, who works for Sport Scotland in Cumbrae. The film takes an active swing, Cumbrae may be one of the smallest isles in the CalMac network but it has a wealth of challenging outdoor activities to take on.</p>
