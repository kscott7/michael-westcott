          <p>An award winning short film showing the work of Stramash and the difference the organisation is making in the lives of children, young people and families in Scotland. My goal was to create a three-minute film showcasing the organisations broad range of activities they offer and how their work impacts young peopleâ€™s lives in Scotland. The film won the Peebles Outdoor Film Festival in 2016.</p>
