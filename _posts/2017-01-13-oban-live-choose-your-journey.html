          <p>"Oban Live Choose your Journey." Which route will you take? Rail, Sail or Road?Super proud of this and hope you all enjoy it and perhaps see you at the gig itself? Shot on Sony A7Sii with Canon UK and Tamron Lenses USA glass. Also used Glidecam Industries, Inc. and Freefly Systems to help me achieve cinematic shots to tell the story! Huge thanks to ScotRail, CalMac Ferries, VisitScotland and all the actors that helped made this happen! Special thanks to OBAN LIVE for giving me the opportunity to create this film for them! Tracks in the film are Toploader, Skerryvore, Skipinnish and Tide Lines</p>
