          <p>Attack Pattern Delta, a band based in Aberdeen, Scotland release their single from their brand new EP - "Vanishing Point." Colossus on the Horizon is of a self-contained concept and is told from the perspective of a person looking objectively at the state of the modern world and the growing global fear of self-annihilation through nuclear weaponry. The person is lamenting and despairs at the lack of empathy shown by our leaders, human blood lust, and fears for family and friends in the days to come. Filmed on the Panasonic EVA1,Sony A7Sii and DJI Phantom 3 Pro cameras.</p>
